# Implementation
I implemented the software with scalability in mind. Most of the features can easily be extended or new content can quickly be added.
Some features are partially included but not activated in the final release. This is due to the time issue explained in the section "Problems".
I also reduced the effort to fill the game with high quality textual content. Some parts are written in a way which shows the functionality, but is not typographical pleasing. This is again due to time issues. 

# Problems
The biggest issue i faced was the difference between "normal" c++ and the version the Unreal Engine uses. 
Over the last years i mostly developed code using the Unreal Engine, which uses a lot of other classes and styleguides.
However a lot of the programming concepts are the same, so the switch took some time and then it worked pretty well.

Another issue was the time. I am working fulltime, so finding the time for the project was difficult. 
However with a reduction in the features i was able to finish a working version.

# Skills sheet
I was not able to edit the provided skills sheed. For the pdf version i donÂ´t have the necessary subscriptions
and the word version is corrupted with my version of word (I have attached a screenshot inside the repositories "delivery" folder.)
The skills tables are provided inside the "Skills Test Programming.pdf" file, for the projects i have submitted my portfolio.
